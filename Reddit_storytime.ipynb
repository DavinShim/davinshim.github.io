            "Enter your story:AITA for leaving my sister's wedding but keeping the bribe I was paid to attend? My brother is an asshole and has made my life hell since I can remember. I grey rocked him scsoon as I understood the concept and have been NC with him since he moved out of my parent's house.  My sister was getting married. I checked to see if he was invited. He was. I RSVP'd my regrets. My sister and parents came by to talk me into attending. I said fuck no.  They promised me that he would be on his best behavior. I said no. They begged. I said no.  They asked if there was anything they could do to convince me to go. I said that if they gave me $1,000 each that I would return if he left me alone. They said no. I said good day.  They came back with $2,000 in an envelope.  I was at the wedding venue with my wife talking to my parents when my brother arrived. He came right over and called me a slur for a homosexual. My dad's head just dropped.  I took my wife's hand and we went out for a night paid for by my parents and sister.  We were already dressed up so we had a fancy night out with our phones off.  My parents and sister are furious at my brother. He is mad because my dad told him that he is a child that can't control himself. My brother is mad at me for being a baby and not being able to take a joke.  I really don't care. $2,000 isn't bablot of money. But it is enough to sting. Now maybe they will listen when I say I do not want to be around him.  My mom however is mad at me for taking the money. She seems to think I was being paid to out up with his abuse. I have tried explaining that it was more of a bond on his behaviour. She won't listen.  AITA for taking the money and leaving?\n"
